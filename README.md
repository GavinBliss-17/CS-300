What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Our core issue was centered around managing and accessing course information within a software system in an efficient manner. 
This involves loading courses from a file, inserting those courses in a data structure, and providing relevant functionalities such as searching and displaying course details. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

A data structure needed to be decided upon, and arriving at the binary search tree as the most appropriate structure as the structure was the beginning. 
The reasoning here lies in the BSTâ€™s ability to maintain elements in a sorted order, which enables efficient searching, insertion, and in-order traversal. 
Implementing functions to load course data from files and manage them using the BST structure ensures that the data is accessible and manageable in an efficient manner.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The project really illuminated the importance of making the appropriate choice of a data structure and how this impacts the potential efficiency and usefulness of the program.
This is not a choice to make based on individual preferences, but a decision that impacts program performance, scalability, and more. 
For example, an array will offer fast access through indices for programs that need elements to be quickly retrieved, however a linked list will be better suited for an app that requires regular insertions and deletions of elements.
